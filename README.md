# Grid Coloring:

Objective: The game allows users to create and manipulate a grid of colored blocks, providing a playful and interactive building experience. Users can customize block colors, adjust the grid size, and use various controls to modify their creations.

Key Components: Header (<h1>) Displays the title of the game, "Grid Coloring,"centered at the top of the page.

Control Panel (controls) Color Picker (<input type="color" id="colorPicker">): Allows users to select a color for painting blocks.

The chosen color is displayed in the <span> element below the picker. Buttons: Clear Grid (<button id="clearGrid">): Clears all colors from the grid, resetting it to the initial state.

Undo (<button id="undo">): Reverts the last color change made to a block.

Redo (<button id="redo">): Reapplies the most recently undone color change.

Block Size (<input type="number" id="blockSize">): Allows users to set the size of each block in the grid. Ranges from 20 to 100 pixels.

Grid Size (<input type="number" id="gridSize">): Adjusts the number of rows and columns in the grid. Ranges from 5x5 to 20x20 blocks. Game Area (game) Grid (<div id="grid">): The interactive grid where users paint blocks. The grid dynamically updates based on user input for block size and grid size.

Background Music (<audio id="backgroundMusic">) Plays a soothing background track to enhance the gaming experience. The music is set to loop continuously.

Behavior: Grid Initialization: When the game loads, a grid of blocks is created based on default settings. Each block is a clickable square that changes color based on the selected color.

Interactivity: Clicking a Block: Changes the block's color to the one chosen from the color picker.

Undo/Redo: Allows users to manage their actions, either reverting changes or reapplying them.

Adjusting Size: Modifying block or grid sizes updates the grid’s appearance dynamically.

Background Music: Plays automatically when the game starts, creating a relaxing atmosphere.

CSS and JavaScript Integration: CSS (styles.css): Styles the game’s appearance, including the layout, colors, and animations. Ensures the grid is centered and maintains a modern look.

JavaScript (script.js): Handles the game logic: Creates and updates the grid based on user input. Manages color changes, undo/redo functionality, and adjusts the grid layout. Overall, this setup provides a responsive, interactive building game where users can experiment with colors and grid sizes while enjoying background music.
